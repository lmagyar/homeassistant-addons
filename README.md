# My Home Assistant Add-ons

This is a reference to my add-ons as of 2025.11.27, not updated later.

## Installation

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** ->
   **Add-on Store**.
1. In the **...** menu at the top right corner click **Repositories**, add
   `https://github.com/lmagyar/homeassistant-addons` as repository.
1. Find the add-on you want and click it. If it doesn't show up, wait until HA
   refreshes the information about the add-on, or click **Check for updates** in
   the **...** menu at the top right corner.
1. Click on the "INSTALL" button.
